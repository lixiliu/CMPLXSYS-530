&nbsp; 

### Goal 
*****
 
_With increasing energy efficiency and smart features that can adapt to occupants' perferences and communicate with other appliances, smart lighting can improve the quality of modern life while reducing energy use and carbon footprint. This study explores whether smart lighting sensors and program can help minimize energy rebound, a common behavioral tendency in which occupants increase consumption post-adoption of more energy-efficient products, thus leading to an erosion of energy savings._

&nbsp;  
### Justification
****
_Agent-based modeling is used to examine system-level behaviors that are emerging from individual agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. It is thus useful for exploring the nexus between smart/connected lighting and occupantsâ€™ preference/comfort. An agent-based model can reveal the emergent patterns that arise from how occupants interact with smart sensors and how smart sensors, in turn, affect their lifestyle. Understanding these interactions can enhance the use of energy efficiency and demand response as viable tools for lowering building energy costs and improving the reliability of the power grid._

## Model Outline

&nbsp; 
### 1) Environment
_The environment consists of a single office room serving a speficic function (e.g. room with individual work spaces/cubicles, conference room, pantry, restroom). Its layout (e.g. size, window and door locations) will be defined in the setup._

* _Boundary conditions: fixed (enclosed by walls)_
* _Dimensionality: 2D_
* _List of environment-owned variables:_
  + _current harvested lux [lux = lumen/sq m] (amount of daylight entering the room through controllable window blinds)_
  + _previous harvested lux [lux]_
  + _current lamp lux [lux] (from overhead lamps)_
  + _previous lamp lux [lux]_
  + _current total lux [lux] (total in-door brightness from overhead lamps and harvested daylight)_
  + _previous total lux [lux]_
  + _current room temperature [deg F]_
  + _previous room temperature [def F]_
  + _Light energy [kWh]_
  + _HVAC energy [kWh]_
* _List of environment-owned methods/procedures:_
  + _update lux (based on previous indoor states, outdoor conditions, and sensor inputs)_
  + _update room temp (based on previous indoor states, outdoor conditions, and sensor inputs)_
  + _calculate energy (after update to indoor states)_


```python
### Pseudocode ###
def initialize_room():
  gridlen = 15 # x[m] includes some space outside of office
  gridwid = 10 # y[m] includes some space outside of office
  RoomX = range(1,13) # x = 12[m] office length
  RoomY = range(1,9) # y = 8[m] office width
  
  #set walls for office
  #set windows
  #set door
  for x in roomX:
    for y in roomY:
      Cur_harv_lux = 0 # blinds closed, no harvest
      Cur_lamp_lux = 0 #
      Cur_total_lux = Cur_harv_lux + Cur_lamp_lux
      Cur_room_temp = 70 # [deg F]
  Pre_harv_lux = Cur_harv_lux
  Pre_lamp_lux = Cur_harv_lux
  Pre_total_lux = Cur_harv_lux
  Pre_room_temp = Cur_room_temp
  
  Light_energy = [0]
  HVAC_energy = [0]
  
def Update_lux():

def Update_room_temp(Pre_room_temp,Outdoor_temp,Sensors):


def calc_energy():
  Light_energy.append = f(lamp_efficacy,lamp_distribution,Cur_lamp_lux)
  HVAC_energy.append = AC_load*Sensors['HVAC'][2] 
```

### 2) Agents
 
 _There are two main types of agents. The first type is **occupants** in the building, each with a specific schedule, preferences, and comfort level._ 
* _List of occupant-owned variables:_
  + _ID
  + _schedule (e.g. when to enter and leave room)_
  + _brightness preference_
  + _thermal preference_ 
  + _discomfort level (preference satisfaction, equally weighted between brightness and temperature)_
  + _current position_
  + _previous position_
* _List of occupant-owned methods/procedures:_
  + _enter room_
  + _exit room_
  + _move (with some probability of being still, e.g. sitting at a meeting, working at a desk)_
  + _check discomfort_

_The second type of agents is **sensors**, which include: motion sensors, daylight controllers, dimmers and HVAC controller._
1. _**Motion sensors** turn lights on based on occupants' movement and keep them on for some time after the last detected movement. Motion sensors are best for high-motion, low traffic rooms such as restrooms or pantry._
* _List of motion sensor-owned variables:_
  + _motion detected (binary)_
  + _timer (number of time steps since the last detected motion)_
* _List of motion sensor-owned methods/procedures:_
  + _check motion_
  + _turn lights on_
  + _turn lights off_

2. _**Daylight controllers** control how much sunlight enters the room by adjusting the window blinds._
* _List of daylight sensor-owned variables:_
  + _None_
* _List of daylight sensor-owned methods/procedures:_ 
  + _adjust blinds (% daylight harvested)_

3. _**Dimmers** instaneously adjust the indoor light level based on the daylight sensor input and the desired indoor lumen level. The dimming is embedded within the motion sensor-owned procedures._

4. _**HVAC controller** controls the room temperature based on the daylight sensor input and the desired indoor temperature. In a cooling mode, when the room temperature rises above a thermostat threshold, the ventilation or AC system would kick in to cool the room until the temperature falls below another thermostat threshold, after which point, the room could heat up again with time and the cycle perpectuates until either the thermostat is turned off or the room temperature ceases to fluctuate beyond the thermostat threholds._
* _List of HVAC controller-owned variables:_
  + _AC on (binary)_
* _List of HVAC controller-owned methods/procedures:_
  + _check HVAC_
